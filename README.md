# vehicle-price-prediction-using-ML
This project predicts the price of used cars based on features like brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms to build an accurate predictive model.
